                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>I have two goals with this website.  My two goals are to impress anyone who visits it mainly.  Another is to show off the team and represent paintball in a good way so people know it is that out team actually does.</p>
                    <h3>Host Url</h3>
                    <p>I decided to go with Godaddy for the website hosting.  The websites URL is <a href="http://843paintball.com/index.html" target="_blank">843paintball.com</a>.  It is not secure as of right now.  I am going to work on getting it to secure though before the website is finalized.</p>
                    <h3>Navigation Menu</h3>
                    <p>As for the Navigation Menu I went with a Home, Bio, Roster, Events, Gallery, and a Contact Us pages.</p>
                    <h3>Information and Resources</h3>
                    <p>For my information I dont need much but I do need to have a record of what the team has done since it was made.  Also fo the resources I must amast a collection of photos and some edited videos my brother makes to put throught the site to keep it visually apealing and intresting to browse.</p>
